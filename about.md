Hello there! 

This is a small crevice of the internet where I store my biscuit crumbs: small tidbits of interesting findings, as well as some examples of my work.

Primarily, this involves designing and coding websites. But I do other things as well; believe it or not, I have a degree in Mathematics!

If you are looking for some help with writing (scientific) programs in C or C++ (with STL and/or Boost), I may be of use. Data structures and parallel programming (OpenMP, MPI, Nvidia CUDA) are also my personal favourite areas of research. You might find some posts on these subjects over at my [blog.](/)

Currently, I'm planning on learning Ruby and Python, with applications to web development, and potentially software development. I always [keep notes](https://github.com/gobbledygook88/Notes-On) when I'm learning something new; you may also find them useful.

Aside from all that funny business, I also curate a small interactive tutorial site over at [LaTeX Tutorials](http://latextutorials.co.uk). It's aimed at beginners and first-year university students who want to typeset reports and assignments. Go check it out and have fun!

All the best,

Marcus
