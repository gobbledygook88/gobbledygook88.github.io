Hello there! 

This is a small crevice of the internet where I store my biscuit crumbs: small tidbits of interesting findings, as well as some examples of my [work](/work).

Primarily, this involves designing and coding websites. But I do other things as well; believe it or not, I have a degree in Mathematics!

If you are looking into writing (scientific) programs in C or C++, I may be able to help. Data structures and high performance computing are also my personal favourite areas of research. You might find some posts on these subjects over at my [blog.](/)

Currently, I'm planning on learning Ruby and Python, with applications to web development, and potentially software development. I always [keep notes](https://github.com/gobbledygook88/Notes-On) when I'm learning something new; you may also find them useful.

Aside from all that funny business, I also curate a small interactive tutorial site over at [LaTeX Tutorials](http://latextutorials.co.uk). It's aimed at beginners and first-year university students who want to typeset reports and assignments. Go check it out and have fun!

All the best,

Marcus
