Having handed in my dissertation a few days ago, I thought it would be a good time to bring my personal website back to life!

I'm trying something new here by using Jekyll and hosting it on Github. So far it's been awesome. None more so since finding the [Scribble theme](http://scribble.muan.co/2013/05/06/scribble-the-jekyll-theme/) by [Mu-An Chiou](http://muan.co/). I opted for an existing Jekyll theme, rather than building my own, so that the site would be up as quickly as possible.

Working in the command-line (git, ruby, vim) is also integrated in my current workflow. Perfect!

So here we have it: a simple, minimalistic blog where I store my biscuit crumbs of interesting tidbits. Call it a cookie jar if you will.

I've learnt a lot over the past year, so I'm hoping to write up some posts before I forget. Hope you all enjoy it!
