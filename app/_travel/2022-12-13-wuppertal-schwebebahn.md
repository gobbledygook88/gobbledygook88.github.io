One of the key journeys I wanted to take as part of my trip from London to Budapest was this hanging monorail in Wuppertal. It can be done as a day excursion from either Cologne or Dusseldorf. I decided to stay a night in Wuppertal, though there was not much to see or do (apart from the monorail of course!)

Wuppertal station is a good place to start and get your bearings. The tourist information centre has lots of information on the monorail. You can even purchase a model of the monorail, which I just had to do albeit now weighed with the burden of carrying it to Budapest with no space in my backpack.

Otherwise, purchasing a ticket is straightforward. Opt for the ticket which allows you unlimited travel in one day. This means you can go up and down the whole of the line as many times as you like, and even make it back to your starting city.

Travelling the whole line only takes around 35 minutes. The majority of the time, it hangs above the river Wupper before transitioning above a road.

All in all, a must-visit monorail if you are in the area.
