  - title: Sharp Island, Sai Kung
    latitude: 22.366153001824696
    longitude: 114.28838254023238
    text: The journey to Sharp Island involved rides on a train, then a treacherous light bus on mountain roads, and finally a boat. All in all, pretty fun! The views and clear waters around Sai Kung are truly beautiful and is a great place to unwind and relax, especially on a sunny day. A boat tour from Sai Kung Pier will take you around Sharp Island initially to take a look at some famous rock formations and secluded beaches. Afterwards, you get as much time as you like to wonder around the island before taking one of the half-hourly return boats. Sai Kung itself is great to walk around too with plenty of seafood restaurants and cafes.

  - title: Tsim Sha Tsui
    latitude: 22.29330404981143
    longitude: 114.16988746527375
    text: Tsim Sha Tsui classic tourist destination. So much to see here and take photos. The classic Hong Kong junk boats and ferry crossings can be taken here. If so inclined, there is a light show at 8pm every night - not that good to be honest, but the atmosphere is nice after the sun sets.

  - title: Victoria Peak, Central
    latitude: 22.271090297710195
    longitude: 114.14994831409764
    text: A trip up to Victoria Peak is a must on a nice day. The tram ride is a great experience - it is actually quite steep! Once at the top, the views are excellent looking back over the city. So many new buildings since I last came here some 20+ years ago!

  - title: Austin
    latitude: 22.302915740754543
    longitude: 114.16698137237259
    text: More stunning architecture near Austin - from the Opera House to the Austin train station which is the terminal for the high speed trains from China.

  - title: Hong Kong Palace Museum, Kowloon
    latitude: 22.301572884348925
    longitude: 114.15525114104142
    text: The Palace Museum has quite a lot of permanent exhibitions and they house lots of relics from the Forbidden Palace in Beijing. Every hall has so much information and history so two to three hours are definitely recommended.

  - title: Wan Chai
    latitude: 22.277526832156973
    longitude: 114.17334176624445
    text: Riding the trams on Hong Kong Island are a must. They are very cheap to travel on too. Board on the back, and pay when you get off at the front. Would also recommend walking on the side streets parallel to the main Wan Chai road - there are much fewer people and lots of small cafes and shops to experience. Times Square used to be one of the main shopping malls in Hong Kong. Nice to see it is still there, but certainly looks its age.

  - title: Hong Kong Heritage Museum, Sha Tin
    latitude: 22.37665393598954
    longitude: 114.18558438604177
    text: I actually liked the Heritage Museum compared to the Palace Museum. It is much smaller, but has a lot more related to Hong Kong culture.

  - title: Airside, Kai Tak
    latitude: 22.33131264161271
    longitude: 114.19812974909196
    text: Last time I was in Hong Kong, Kai Tak was still very much wasteland. Now it is a bustling town. The Airside shopping mall is a great place to shop and eat food. It also has a viewing terrace where you can see down the old airport runways and see multiple sports stadiums and parks.

    latitude: 22.28212021727075
    longitude: 114.19040691466894
    text: Lastly, as is the tradition at the end of the year, a visit to the Expo is a must. So many stalls to peruse and lots and lots of discounts! Everyone will definitely come empty handed and leave with lots of shopping!
