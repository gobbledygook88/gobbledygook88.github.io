    text: Most will likely start at East Grinstead given the connections to London. Ticket purchasing was efficient and leaflets are handed out with information for the day. Steam train times seemed to have been scheduled to fit Southern Rail's timetable which was much appreciated. Seating on the steam trains are first come first serve, and the interiors are utterly delightful. Arguably a lot more comfortable than today's trains. Soon enough, we were on the move and chortling down the tracks!

    text: The last stop on the Bluebell Railway. It is a great place to explore more of the train as the locomotive is reversed to the other end of the train ready to get moving again. There is also a pub and Bluebell Railways' shop.

Following a thoroughly enjoyable day out on the Watercress Line a few years ago, an impromptu weekend outing was set in motion. This time, the World War II themed day was being held on the Bluebell Railway, titled "Southern at War".

It is a great opportunity to ride steam trains up and down the line, alongside very well dressed members of the public. The entertainment was great too.

A suggestion would be to pack a picnic. Often times the event is held at the beginning of summer and the weather is pleasant. Since these stations are somewhat out of the way, there are not many choices for sustenance during a full day of spending time on the trains. Another would be to study the train timetable beforehand, so you can plan what route and stops you'd like to take.
