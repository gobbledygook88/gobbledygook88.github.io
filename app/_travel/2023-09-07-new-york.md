      longitude: -73.77946878964508
      text: Getting from the airport to Downtown was a relatively simple affair, if you are packing light and only have a backpack or small suitcase. Board the AirTrain to Jamaica Station. You don't pay when you get on, but rather when you get off, by purchasing a Metrocard at the machines (cards accepted). Then walk over to the Long Island Railroad. Buy another ticket from one of the machines there and board the next train. Alight at Penn Station, which is a short walk to Times Square or change platforms to take the subway. The subway can be paid with contactless cards. Three different ways to pay for public transport. You can probably tell what I think about this.

      latitude: 40.751736249446736
      longitude: -73.99593264330034
      text: If you have some spare time, go up to the main hall at Penn. It is classic American train station architecture with a massive glass ceiling.
    - title: Grand Central
      latitude: 40.75333217148337
      longitude: -73.97679198507319
      text: An equally amazing train station. The main hall is absolutely beautiful with lots of archways to all the different platforms. There is also a food court in the basement too which is worth walking around.

      latitude: 40.7769572541032
      longitude: -73.97036508712523
      text: Take the subway north to any of the stations near Central Park. The really nice parts are towards the Lake and Reservoir. In fact, it is well worth walking all around the reservoir. If time allows, exit the park on the east side to visit the Guggenheim Museum. Alternatively, The Metropolitan Museum of Art is located within Central Park itself. Try not to use any maps. Just walk along any path that looks interesting. There are lots of hidden nooks which offer great views of the city around the park.

      latitude: 40.75636758586249
      longitude: -74.00371063511668
      text: An elevated disused railway line turned public walking park. Really cool place to walk and take in the sights. There are plenty of benches along the length of the line to rest too.

      latitude: 40.7425441248862
      longitude: -74.0061793457975
      text: Alternatively, if you are hungry after walking the High line, head to Chelsea Market. It is a large building housing copious amounts of food vendors. Queue up, order your food and then find a place to sit to eat. There is seating outside too. Would highly recommend a place called Very Fresh Noodles. Their noodles will leave your mouth numb indeed. There are also plenty of shops inside too to stroll around.

      latitude: 40.761419489333576
      longitude: -73.97760931559881
      text: So many floors of beautiful art. You can spend a whole day here, but 3-4 hours is plenty. There isn't really a good cafe here so when you inevitably get tired feet, it might be a good idea to head out to a nearby cafe or restaurant.

      longitude: -73.99756310351408
      text: A relatively large Chinatown with lots of restaurants (Joe's Shanghai). There is a friendly cheung fun hole-in-the-wall (Yi Ji Shi Mo), dim sum takeaway shops (Mei Lei Wah) and lots of bakeries too. Standard levels of service from any Chinatown around the world.

      latitude: 40.70128356058126
      longitude: -74.01320938192634
      text: Take subway 1 to South Ferry terminal and walk over to Whitehall Terminal. Wait in the main hall for the next Staten Island Ferry. It is free to take, no ticket needed. Once on board, stand at the railings on the right hand side for views of the Statue of Liberty. Once at Staten Island, just fast walk around to catch the next one back.

This was my first visit to New York. I took a really early flight over from London Heathrow and returned on a red-eye before heading straight to work. I think most people do this.

Five days is a really good amount of time to spend in New York. You'll have a chance to visit the classic tourist sites of Times Square, Broadway, Fifth Avenue, Empire State Building, Rockefeller Center, Flatiron Building and Brooklyn Bridge. All the while taking in the day-to-day atmosphere of various districts. Not to mention hotels in New York are ridiculously priced, so spending any more time will certainly break the bank.

Aside from that, a visit to a CVS or Walgreens is a must. Stock up on copious amounts of pharmaceutical products just for the ridiculousness.

Oh, and Trader Joe's. It is good fun.

The city is actually quite walkable. Sure, the grid system means you'll be spending a lot of time waiting for traffic lights, but at least you can walk (not like many other American cities where a car is a necessity). Central Park is also a delightful place to cycle and stroll around.
