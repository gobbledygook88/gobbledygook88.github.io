    text: Arriving bright and early at 8am to Union Station, I walked through the station, down a ramp, and dropped off my large suitcase knowing I wouldn't see it again until Vancouver. Checking in for the train at the Business Lounge was a simple affair - provide your name and they'll confirm which carriage and compartment I had been allocated. Afterwards, I had to see a gentleman down the way to collect a meal ticket. Since I was early, I had choice between the first or second sitting. Some drinks are available in the lounge, otherwise, I was free to roam around and relax.

    text: In due time, we were called through to board the train. Seeing the train up close was breath-taking. Huge metal walls was the first thought. Each sleeper carriage has an attendant and they were waiting at the door to greet each of us, letting us know where our room was. Since I was the only passenger in our carriage going all the way to Vancouver, I had to learn some emergency evacuation procedures. Nothing too difficult. Soon after, I got acquainted with my neighbour and we both headed to the Park Car. Since this was off-season, all sleeper passengers had access to the Prestige class observation car at the rear of the train (another reason why I chose to travel in the winter). As we pulled out the station we could see the CN Tower and sit to be served mimosas and canapes. Delicious.

    text: Having had a chance to settle into my room and explore a bit more of the train, of which it is certainly big, it was time for lunch. Both lunch and dinner are 3 course meals and cooked fresh on board the train. Each meal provides a chance to meet new people and discover new perspectives from all walks of life, while being united by a love of the train. After meals, most people head back to their rooms for a short rest. The kitchen certainly does not hold back on portion sizes!

One of the longest single train journeys in the world, travelling across Cannada from Toronto to Vancouver. I chose this direction because I wanted to end in Jasper National Park and spend a few days in Vancouver too. I had been to Vancouver before and vowed to come back as it is an amazing place.

I booked this trip 9 months in advance as I knew tickets would go quickly. If I had more forethought (and money) I could have tried to link together more trains through America. Many of the passengers I met on the train were doing that.

The allure of having 4 days of no mobile phone signal, no wifi, and 3 course meals was too great. There was no pressure to socialise, and everyone was utterly kind with fascinating lives to tell.

I also chose to travel in the winter to get the full experience of Canadian winter. Some places we stopped at was -10C and the snowy mountains did not disappoint!
