Vietnam was a last minute addition to the round the world trip, which meant not much forethought went into the visit. Unfortunately, December in Vietnam can bring unpredictable weather. Rain and grey skies were common, though when it did rain it was only for a short time. Relaxing on the beaches were not possible though due to strong waves and winds.

I was also not prepared for how stressful travelling in Vietnam would be. The amount of traffic was a lot more than I expected, and the sheer lack of pedestrian infrastructure made walking around towns and cities very tiring. It was not really what I needed after travelling for 3.5 months already.

Luckily, the visit was short and there were still some nice places to visit across Vietnam.
