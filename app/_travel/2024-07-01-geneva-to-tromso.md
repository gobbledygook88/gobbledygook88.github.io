    latitude: 51.5329977446607
    longitude: -0.12674994264680498
    text: I'm a great fan of early flights, especially on budget airlines. There are fewer chances of delays and drunk stag/hen parties. This time, was a 6:45am flight from London Gatwick airport and arrived into Geneva at 9:10am (local time). Speedy. The train into Geneva proper is easy and only one stop from the airport.
  - title: Geneva
    latitude: 46.20458800534425
    longitude: 6.152275476396875
    text: Geneva is pretty easy to walk around. A short stroll down from the train station gets you to the lake. Across the bridge and you'll be in the English Garden, which is an excellent place to relax and get your bearings. A pilgrimage to the mighty Swiss watch boutiques is a must; conveniently they are all on one street. Visiting the Saint-Pierre cathedral is also recommended.
  - title: Montreux
    latitude: 46.43607252275955
    longitude: 6.910515919555523
    text: Montreux is stunningly beautiful. The train from Montreux travels along the lake side. After Lausanne you're peering over the water; sit on the right side for great views. The path beside the lake has well-pruned flowers and a few spots to take a dip in Lake Geneva. The supermarket in the shopping centre is a convenient place to gather some supplies.
  - title: Rochers-de-Naye
    latitude: 46.43171367452
    longitude: 6.978960325539971
    text: A trip up to Rochers-de-Naye is a must if you're ever in Montreux. It is just a short journey on the cog railway; expect steep inclines and sheer cliff edges. Once at the top, the views are incredible. There is a large chance of clouds, but the ticket office will check and let you know when you buy tickets. There is a cafe, restaurant and toilets available. The alpine garden is a short walk away. The path does get a little scary but it is generally ok. If time allows, the 5 hour hike back down to Montreux will be great. Something I'll try next time.

Since I went west to east across Europe on the train a couple of years prior, I thought it only right that I go south to north. My original plan started in Seville going all the way to Tromso. However, travelling in July in southern Spain (i.e. 40C temperatures) was not going to happen. A few key train journeys were on the cards for this journey. The rest of the trains on this trip were essentially to join the dots.

* Cog railway from Montreux to Rochers-de-Naye
* Golden Pass from Montreux to Interlaken
* Jungfrau
* OBB NightJet from Zurich to Hamburg
* Arctic sleeper train from Stockholm to Narvik

As you'll eventually read, some of these just were not possible. Guess I'll just have to go back!
