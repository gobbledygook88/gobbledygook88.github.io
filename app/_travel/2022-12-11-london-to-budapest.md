    text: The original plan was to take the OBB NightJet from Dusseldorf to Vienna. But I left it too late to book tickets, and so the only way to take the NightJet was to hot foot it over to Hannover. As you can see from the map, it was quite a diversion.

    text: Vienna is a special place. Arguably my favourite city in Europe (a discussion for another time). At least Austria is one of my top three countries in Europe to visit. I had a few hours before my scheduled train to Budapest. I wanted to drop off my bags in the lockers at the main station, but didn't have any cash on me. Alas, I had to take them with me into the city. Luckily, I only had one goal in Vienna. That was to visit Figlmuller to eat schnitzel again.

An impromptu week of train travel across Europe, stopping off at various Christmas markets. There were two key journeys on this trip: the suspended monorail in Wuppertal and the sleeper train to Vienna. Every other journey was planned around those, all the while visiting places I had not been to before.
