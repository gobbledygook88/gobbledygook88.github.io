  - title: London to Brussels
    latitude: 51.5329977446607
    longitude: -0.12674994264680498
    text: Despite choosing to take a really early train, Eurostar is ever popular and departures is extremely packed so much so every seat was taken on the train also. All in all, an uneventful train journey to Brussels. Not the best experience given a large section of the journey is underground. Purely functional.
  - title: Brussels
    latitude: 50.83622576041437
    longitude: 4.336118903248739
    text: Brussels had a few interesting spots of interest - the Porte de Hal, the Palais de Justice, Notre-Dame, Palais de Bruxelles, Grand Place and of course Mannekin Pis. Following these landmarks provided a delightful tour of the city, with plenty of spots to rest and people watch. The Christmas market was held towards the west of the city and was definitely more fun to visit at night time.
  - title: Cologne
    latitude: 50.94311233864501
    longitude: 6.958732323298055
    text: Cologne's train station is magnificent. So many platforms and opportunities to spot trains given a vast amount pass through in quick succession. Once I could pry myself out of the station, I was immediately greeted by the largest Gothic church in Northern Europe. The Christmas market was just next to the cathedral. Offerings were limited but good to walk around and snack nonetheless.
  - title: Wuppertal
    latitude: 51.254522785942534
    longitude: 7.1500507787919325
    text: Monorail
  - title: Dusseldorf to Hannover
    latitude: 51.21994820776217
    longitude: 6.79335864837367
    text: The original plan was to take the OBB NightJet from Dusseldorf to Vienna. But I left it too late to book tickets, and so the only way to take the NightJet was to hot foot it over to Hannover. As you can see from the map, it was quite a diversion.
  - title: Hannover to Vienna
    latitude: 52.377039385186514
    longitude: 9.74166842788251
    text: Stopover for a few hours to catch the night train. a little chaotic. last minute platform change (seems like a regular thing). utterly freezing
  - title: Vienna to Budapest
    latitude: 48.18509329216569
    longitude: 16.37684623124785
    text: Vienna is a special place. Arguably my favourite city in Europe (a discussion for another time). At least Austria is one of my top three countries in Europe to visit. I had a few hours before my scheduled train to Budapest. I wanted to drop off my bags in the lockers at the main station, but didn't have any cash on me. Alas, I had to take them with me into the city. Luckily, I only had one goal in Vienna. That was to visit Figlmuller to eat schnitzel again.
  - title: Budapest
    latitude: 47.500409527921455
    longitude: 19.084794563456843
    text: few days in budapest exploring the city before flying back home to London

An impromptu week of train travel across Europe, stopping off at various Christmas markets. There were two key journeys on this trip: the suspended monorail in Wuppertal and the sleeper train to Vienna. Every other journey was planned around those, all the while visiting places I had not been to before.
