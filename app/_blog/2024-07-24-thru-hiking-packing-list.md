title: Thru-hiking / camping packing list
categories: blog
---

Having gone down the rabbit hole of camping gear and ultra-light gear, here is my current kit list for camping trips and thru-hikes. I don't have a true ultra-light pack (considered to be 4.5kg base weight or lower) but rather a lightweight setup (9kg or lower).

On the South Downs Way walk, my total pack weight (including consumables and electronics) came to 12.5kg. While it was manageable, it definitely highlighted that I have minimal core strength. I would be keen to hear tips on further reducing weight!

### Summary

| Category       | Total weight (kg) |
| -------------- | ----------------: |
| Base weight    |               5.5 |
| Consumables    |               2.4 |
| Clothes packed |                   |
| Clothes worn   |                   |
