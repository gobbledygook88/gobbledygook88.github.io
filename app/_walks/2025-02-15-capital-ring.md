      text: There is no official starting point but it seemed most people start in Woolwich (at least that is where the AllTrails route starts). With easy to moderate difficulty, this section was a good warm up for things to come. The stroll along the Thames at the beginning was really nice (always good to see the Thames). Then the uphill section towards Severndroog Castle and Shooters Hill gave panoramic views back towards the City. Lunch was at the Harvesters in Falconwood, before a lot of pavement walking to finish at Grove Park train station.

      text: Feeling pretty good on this day, we bundled along towards Crystal Palace on a good pace via some local parks and nature reserves. It was a Sunday, so the market was open in Crystal Palace park. Perfect lunch spot (if you can find a bench to sit on). Next up was a section I was dreading - the hills of South London. The climb up to Norwood and Streatham I had walked before, but this time after already walking 12km it was a bit harder than needed. Nevertheless, we soldiered on. I was pleasantly surprised that we arrived so quickly to Balham after passing through Tooting Common. An air of familiarity brought a spring to my step, and we resupplied our water before heading towards Wandsworth Common, taking a left down Wandsworth Cemetery before finishing the day at Wimbledon Park tube station.
