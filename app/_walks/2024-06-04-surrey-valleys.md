      latitude : 51.28202574415372
      longitude : -0.07826041260999102
      text: Upon exiting the train station, take a right and walk up Church Street. It quickly becomes apparent that there is no pavement on the right, so you'll need to cross the road and walk up the hill on the left. Its a steep climb to start the hike!
    - title: Rook Lane
      latitude: 51.281274677336235
      longitude: -0.10564969594969881
      text: When walking west on Rook Lane, stay on the left side pavement to avoid hopping back and forth. Seems short pavements are in vogue here. As you advance, keep your eyes peeled for an opening in the bushes across the road. The first one can be easy to miss, but there is another chance 20 metres further along. If walking in spring or summer, this is the beginnings of a day of thorns.
    - text: To the right, you'll spot a golf course through the bushes.

This moderately challenging hike is from the Country Walks book published by London Transport. It passes through the towns of Caterham, Chaldon, Coulsdon, Whyteleafe, Warlingham and Woldingham. On a sunny day, this is a great walk through valleys and pass churches. Expect quite a bit of ascending and decending in the second half.

Unfortunately, there is no convenient pub along the route for lunch, so pack a picnic and enjoy!

Caterham is very easy to get to from Central London: end of the line on Southern Trains. Change at East Croydon.
