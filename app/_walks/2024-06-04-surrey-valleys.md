  waypoints:
    - title: Caterham train station
      latitude : 51.28202574415372
      longitude : -0.07826041260999102
      text: Upon exiting the train station, take a right and walk up Church Street. It quickly becomes apparent that there is no pavement on the right, so you'll need to cross the road and walk up the hill on the left. Its a steep climb to start the hike!
    - title: Rook Lane
      latitude: 51.281274677336235
      longitude: -0.10564969594969881
      text: When walking west on Rook Lane, stay on the left side pavement to avoid hopping back and forth. Seems short pavements are in vogue here. As you advance, keep your eyes peeled for an opening in the bushes across the road. The first one can be easy to miss, but there is another chance 20 metres further along. If walking in spring or summer, this is the beginnings of a day of thorns.
    - latitude: 51.284871086899
      longitude: -0.12109946065354461
      text: As you finish walking past Piles Wood on the right, you are greeted by a wonderful field of crops. Don't worry, you'll be back in here soon.
    - title: Our second church of the day
      latitude: 51.28493948472359
      longitude: -0.1235574450880247
      text: Here you'll find St. Peter and St. Paul's Church, Chaldon. If time allows, take a look around and have a short break before the fun begins.
    - title: A landmark
      latitude: 51.2856961689992
      longitude: -0.12389086372652258
      text: Walking a little up the road, you'll find a signpost signalling to Happy Valley. Walk a little further up and you'll reach the southernmost point of Greater London. Head back to the signpost and re-enter the crop field we had just left. Bear half left as you enter the field and walk straight.
    - title: Embrace jeopardy
      latitude: 51.293628018289596
      longitude: -0.11873334192281404
      text: As we pass between Figgs Wood on the left and the aforementioned Piles Wood on the right, we'll head down the valley. Keep walking straight into what looks like a bush. A path does exist, trust me. You'll be met with a steep climb up some steps which disappear as quickly as they appeared. Luckily, there is a bench two-thirds up the ascent giving a generous place to rest overlooking the valley you just crossed.
    - latitude: 51.29563423211698
      longitude: -0.11184086615916224
      text: Exiting the Happy Valley car park, we enter Coulsdon which turns out to be part of the City of London. Despite your best efforts to leave London for the day, you reluctantly walk back into it while noticing the familiar bus stops and red double-decker buses speeding past. Sigh. Take care crossing the busy Coulsdon Road before entering Coulsdon Common proper.
    - latitude: 51.30749421550536
      longitude: -0.10420517823485109
      text: Enter Betts Mead Recreation Ground.
    - title: Lunch!
      latitude: 51.31263239628262
      longitude: -0.07662525347052745
      text: Here marks our half-way point Whyteleafe Recreation Ground. 10km walked! This is a great spot for lunch; there are a few benches near the children's playground. If you didn't bring a picnic, there is a small cafe at the bottom of the park. Be sure to rest, but not for too long. You'll be in for some fun in the second half where progress will be a lot slower.
    - title: The pain begins...
      latitude: 51.31371151030815
      longitude: -0.07392073560849877
      text: The book gives wonderful descriptions on the route so that this whole hike can be done without GPS. Here it mentions a path parallel to the tennis courts. What it failed to mention was the ridiculous incline.
    - title: A crawl through time
      latitude: 51.31605602479372
      longitude: -0.06823693218826866
      text: Though you'll encounter lots of signs saying driveways are private, ignore them. The ones we walk on today are also public footpaths. This one, however, is not as well kept as others. Running down the side of some Victorian houses, crawl through thorn bushes and trees. Again, trust me. As you pick off the thorns and emerge into a small opening, you are greeted by a signpost signalling a public footpath which probably hasn't greeted a human in many years. You can't help by give a wry smile. Eventually, you'll emerge into John Fisher's Sports Ground. Walk along the edge of the sports field to the other side.
    - title: Bug Hill
      latitude: 51.30249957126309
      longitude: -0.05316188144776937
      text: While walking up Leas Road to Bug Hill, be sure not to miss the side road. Head down the slope. As you walk past the back of a house, you'll encounter a fork. Keep going straight.
    - title: Something is different
      latitude: 51.30140687405973
      longitude: -0.05371141953981574
      text: Here we have my favourite park of the walk (sarcasm). The book suggests walking forward down the hill across to the other side of the field and over some stiles. This no longer exists, but instead a golf course. As is the running theme, a signpost does signal the public footpath still exists across the golf course. If you are confident in golf etiquette, feel free to walk on through. Alternatively, if you are up for risking your life take the dubious public footpath to the right. Here we will skirt around the golf course on a steep slope, through thick thorns and dense trees. Take good care of where you place your feet.
    - title: A short breather
      latitude: 51.28525093064736
      longitude: -0.04361110145808793
      text: On passing a stile, take a short break on some well placed logs. If you're in luck, you'll see lots of horses. As you can probably guess, we'll be descending the valley and then climbing yet again shortly after.
    - title: The final climb?
      latitude: 51.28498806016622
      longitude: -0.05183960210155862
      text: Have to be honest here, this one nearly ended me. By this point, I was done with climbing any more. But alas, this next stretch was the hardest. When you reach the stile at the tree line, you'll realise it keeps on going (but with steps). When you're really at the top, we'll do it all again.
    - title: Oh, there's a dual carriageway to cross too
      latitude: 51.280988399221954
      longitude: -0.07065123801450521
      text: After passing through a new housing estate you'll be greeted by the exhilerating sounds of 60mph cars. A small opening in the trees takes you graciously down to the road side. Look right first. Spot an opening in the cars and commit. Then repeat while looking left. You've made it back to Caterham. Head back to the train station to finish the walk.

This moderately challenging hike is from a Country Walks book published by London Transport. It passes through the towns of Caterham, Chaldon, Coulsdon, Whyteleafe, Warlingham and Woldingham. On a sunny day, this is a great walk through valleys and pass churches. Expect quite a bit of ascending and decending in the second half.

Unfortunately, there is no convenient pub along the route for lunch, so pack a picnic and enjoy!

Caterham is very easy to get to from Central London: end of the line on Southern Trains. Change at East Croydon.
