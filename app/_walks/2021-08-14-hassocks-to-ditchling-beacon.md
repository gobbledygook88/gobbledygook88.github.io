      text: From London, Hassocks is an easy station to reach given it is on the same line as Gatwick Airport and Brighton. It is served by Southern Rail and Thameslink so it covers much of London. Upon arrival (from London), exit the ticket barriers and head down the tunnel to cross to the other side of the tracks. Turn left to the car park and find a set of stairs in the corner. Cross the sometimes busy road under the train bridge and spot a set of stairs up to a pathway.

      text: Follow the pathway for about 1.5km. It is a straight path which follows alongside the railway tracks. There are some stiles leading to other walking routes along the way. Not much of interest here, but there are some openings amongst the bushes and trees which give a glimpse as to our destinations. As we emerge out of the pathway, we get to a busy road. We'll be turning left at the junction, but if there aren't many cars hop over to take a look at the majestic Clayton Tunnel.

      text: Crossing a cricket field through a small set of kissing gates and passing a church, we get to the start of the most strenuous climb of this route. The start of it is amongst trees so we have plenty of shade. About half way, we exit the woods and start traversing up steeper grasslands towards the windmills. Take a second to look backwards towards the north. The views are spectacular.

      text: The Jack and Jill windmills are iconic in this area and in the South Downs national park. This is a great place to catch your breath by sitting on the grassy banks looking back on where we just climbed up. There is a small portable cafe hidden around the corner if you need a drink and snacks. Would suggest taking the anti-clockwise route around the windmills - the clockwise route takes us through narrow overgrown shrubs with many thorns.

      text: As we walk past the windmills, we approach the official South Downs Way path. If you're lucky, you'll also spot some horses! The South Downs Way will start taking us up towards Ditchling Beacon. The path is well signposted and you'll probably see a lot of people here.

      text: About half way along the ridge, you'll come across a dew pond. It has two distinctive windswept trees. It is a nice place to take a break and enjoy the views.

      text: Soon enough, we approach Ditchling Beacon proper. Once you spot the car park from afar, the trig point is on the right of the path. It can be easy to miss if the grass is particularly long.

      text: As we pass the car park (which can get quite busy), there is a small track on the left which follows the main road. Take this path. We will follow this all the way down to the town of Ditchling. The route is relatively steep so watch your footing - it is very easy to slip even on a dry day. In the early months, it may be quite overgrown, but in the summer months it should be quite a pleasant walk.

      text: All paths will eventually lead us to Ditchling, so don't worry about taking a wrong path. Pick the one that looks the most appealing or adventurous. The Bull pub is a delightful establishment serving drinks and food. They have a nice garden round the back with plenty of tables and chairs. It can get very busy later in the day and especially when the weather is beautiful. Nevertheless, this is a great place to get some sustenance and relax.

      text: The walk back to Hassocks is pretty much a straight line from Ditchling and past Keymer. Follow the pavements, crossing when forced to, all the way back. It'll take around 30 minutes, if you wanted to time the walk for your next train. Cross back through the tunnel for the platform for trains back to London.

A delightful 11km walk on the South Downs. It takes in three amazing points of interest: Clayton Train Tunnnel, Jack and Jill Windmills and Ditchling Beacons.

It isn't a particularly challenging walk. The hardest is the short but steep section up to the windmills, but take your time and take breaks if needed. There is no rush.

You'll find many people driving up and parking in the various car parks along the route. The route can be busy on weekends and on sunny days, so go early and enjoy the wonderful South Downs to yourself.

On a good clear day, you may get a glimpse of London to the North and the sea towards the South!
