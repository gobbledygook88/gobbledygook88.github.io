      latitude: 51.3159994783174
      longitude: -0.13797581559225247
      text: The walk starts and ends at Coulsdon South train station. It is a nice little station served by Southern Rail and Thameslink so is very easy to get to, and trains are relatively frequent. When travelling south from London, there is a set of stairs to the left after exiting the ticket barrier. Don't go over the bridge (that'll be for later). A short hop around the corner and you'll be entering Farthing Downs, the entrance of which is marked by some gates. Cars and cyclists will frequent the centre road which cuts through the downs but you won't notice them too much.

      text: Now we begin the gentle incline. It is a straight path up and a nice start to get your bearings as you look back over to Coulsdon. Towards the crest of the hill you'll find information boards about Saxon burial mounds, and some benches to take a break and enjoy the view. A little onwards will also be a Millennium Cairn.

      text: Keep walking straight and you'll eventually reach Farthing Downs car park, a nice place to park if travelling by car. Cross the road and veer down the slope to the left - you'll find a small path in the corner. There are multiple path ways to choose from, but keep right. There will be another information board with a map and some facts about the wildlife.

      text: As you traverse through the woods and come to an opening, there are multiple options. Follow the path down towards the valley floor, or keep right for a bit longer for some more hills. I opted for the hills to get a better view over the meadows which are lovely in the spring. Eventually, you'll have to go down to the path which cuts through the middle of the valley. Keep on the main path as we seamlessly transition from Farthing Downs into Happy Valley.

      text: You will soon enter some woodland area. If you take the route marked on the map, you'll find yourself in some thick bushes, all the while climbing up steep hills. All very fun. There are other paths to choose from though and they all lead roughly to the same places, namely, the Fox pub and Coulsdon Common. This is a great place to stop for lunch or a picnic before turning back.

      text: Instead of going back the way the same way, I chose to explore the other side of the valley. There are many more steep sections, but still really enjoyable. Watch your footing while descending - there are narrow footpaths so be considerate to others and slowly pass each other. This side of the valley has a few more bridleways. These paths are less steep compared to a few of the stairs that are available to take. By this point, I was keeping an eye on the time to decide whether I quicken the pace in order to make the hourly train, or take my time. Luckily, it is mostly downhill towards the train station. I made my train with 5 minutes to spare.

Having crossed this valley on a previous walk ([Surrey Valleys](/walks/surrey-valleys/)), I had bookmarked Farthing Downs as a place to come back to. Luckily, Coulsdon South is just a short train ride away and within 45 mins I was able to be amongst the rolling meadows and shade providing trees.

Much of the route is also part of the London Loop, so I'm sure I'll be back yet another time.
