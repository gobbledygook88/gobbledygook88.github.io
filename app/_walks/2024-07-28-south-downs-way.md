The South Downs Way was my first thru-hike, and even my first ever experience at camping too. I first came across it when walking Ditchling Beacons and Seven Sisters. There were sign posts dotted around and it stuck with me ever since. It was a toss up between this and the North Downs Way, which I have actually walked more of, but the South Downs seemed a little more appealing.

Planning for this hike was relatively easy with lots of information online. I knew I wanted to camp as much as I could, but stick with campsites rather than wild camp. This would be my first time camping, so I needed to get used to my equipment and workflow. Having campsite facilities meant I just felt a little more comfortable.

I used the following to plan each day's route and destination:

* AllTrails - always my starting point for any walk. The GPX file was also loaded onto my Garmin GPSMAP device for en route navigation.
* Google Maps - for looking for campsites and refuelling points. Also Street View for evaluating any potential scary road crossings.
* Trailblazer South Downs Way guidebook - I only thought to buy this the day before I started the hike, and it was satisfying much of my planning was similarly mentioned in the book.

After many years of only doing one day hikes in and about London, and even in other countries, I really wanted to try a multi-day hike. I wanted to find out whether I'd like camping and whether the longer distances is something I was actually looking for. Safe to say, at the end of the South Downs Way, it would be yes to both. Even so, I had a lot of time for contemplating on the hike:

* Be satisfied by walking 20km a day. I had originally planned to walk the whole South Days Way in only 5 days, however, after the first day of 35km it was obvious my body was not fit to do that. Without carrying a large backpack, I previously had walked 20km in about 4-5 hours. 35km with a 13kg backpack took me 9 hours and I was too tired to actually enjoy the walk - something which was really important to me.
* The paths on the South Downs Way have a lot of stones and they hurt. The first few days were the most brutal on the feet. Small and large stones for kilometres meant I had to really learn how to walk differently so to give parts of my feet a rest of the onslaught. Trail runners are great, but I'd actually suggest proper hiking boots.
* I enjoy smashing out a section really early in the morning so I have lunch and the rest of the day to rest and relax. Time off the trail could be enjoyed alongside the walking.
* There were times I was 99% sure I wanted to give up. Either the path became incredibly monotonous and boring, or I was just in too much pain to enjoy walking further. But persevering to the end has its charms.
* Eating was hard for me. Often times, I would just want to power through without breakfast or lunch. But that was dangerous, even more so I was walking in a 30C heatwave and much of the trail was in open fields. I had plenty of water, but not enough food to give me energy and help recover faster.

Finally here are the section breakdowns per day and some numbers:

| Day | Start               | Finish              | Accommodation           | Distance (km) | Elevation (m) | Moving time (hrs) | Average pace (mins/km) | Section time (hrs) | Calories |

As shown in the table, on the first day I tried to match my usual walking pace of 10 mins/km. That was a huge mistake given the extra distance and additional weight. Subsequent days were much more sensible and despite fatigue in the legs, I seemed to keep a consistent pace throughout. Days 4 and 7 had particularly challenging climbs which explains the slower page (more details on that later).

The additional distance (compared to the official 100 miles or 160 kilometres) can be attributed to getting to and from accommodation, food spots, or train stations; I tried to stick to the official route as much as I could but it gives a more realistic overall distance.
