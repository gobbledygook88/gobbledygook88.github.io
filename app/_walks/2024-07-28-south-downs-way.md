The birds will be collectively singing in full around 5am (which I loved). A quick pack up and refill of water bottles meant I set off quite early the next morning.

      text: Walking through Butser Natural Nature Reserve was magical. It is one of the highest points on the South Downs Way, and looking down towards the chalk cliffs above the A3 road was incredible. What made it even more astonishing (with a drop of jeopardy) were the herd of horses galloping right next to me on the way down.

      text: The woods in Queen Elizabeth Country Park were a delight, providing some welcome shade from the early morning sun. If so desired, don't take the wooden stairs up into the woods but rather the road to the cafe for breakfast and water. As you'll read, there are plenty of places for food on the trail, so minimal packing of food is needed for this walk.

      text: A straight path leads slowly down to Manor Farm, which is just south of Cocking. There is a Cadence cafe just before the crossroads with a water tap. It is an excellent place to grab some snacks and drinks if you don't feel like walking into Cocking proper and the highly recommended Blue Bell pub. Cadence cafes will appear regularly along the South Downs Way and are always a welcome sight! Manor Farm is located directly on the trail and its water tap is highly visible. It is a great place to camp and Pauline is an amazing host.

      text: As we cross rivers and train tracks into Amberley, we have another water tap available and views of Amberley Castle. Would recommend taking a detour to Amberley Tea Rooms for a scenic bite to eat next to the river. The train station is also across the road in case you want to cut the trail in half. Since it was forecast to be 32C this afternoon, I had decided I wanted to set off at 7am and make it to Amberley for lunch, during which the sunshine was already really really hot. I walked a little further along the trail to the junction of Mill Lane, at which I took and walked down a steep road towards Amberley town. The Black Horse pub is a great place to stay mid-way through the walk. Wonderful rooms and great food too!

The South Downs Way was my first thru-hike, and even my first ever experience at camping too. I first came across it when walking Ditchling Beacons and Seven Sisters. There were sign posts dotted around and it stuck with me ever since. It was a toss up between this and the North Downs Way, which I have actually walked more of, but the South Downs seemed a little more appealing.

Planning for this hike was relatively easy with lots of information online. I knew I wanted to camp as much as I could, but stick with campsites rather than wild camp. This would be my first time camping, so I needed to get used to my equipment and workflow. Having campsite facilities meant I just felt a little more comfortable.

I used the following to plan each day's route and destination:

* AllTrails - always my starting point for any walk. The GPX file was also loaded onto my Garmin GPSMAP device for en route navigation.
* Google Maps - for looking for campsites and refuelling points. Also Street View for evaluating any potential scary road crossings.
* Trailblazer South Downs Way guidebook - I only thought to buy this the day before I started the hike, and it was satisfying much of my planning was similarly mentioned in the book.

After many years of only doing one day hikes in and about London, and even in other countries, I really wanted to try a multi-day hike. I wanted to find out whether I'd like camping and whether the longer distances is something I was actually looking for. Safe to say, at the end of the South Downs Way, it would be yes to both. Even so, I had a lot of time for contemplating on the hike:

* Be satisfied by walking 20km a day. I had originally planned to walk the whole South Days Way in only 5 days, however, after the first day of 35km it was obvious my body was not fit to do that. Without carrying a large backpack, I previously had walked 20km in about 4-5 hours. 35km with a 13kg backpack took me 9 hours and I was too tired to actually enjoy the walk - something which was really important to me.
* The paths on the South Downs Way have a lot of stones and they hurt. The first few days were the most brutal on the feet. Small and large stones for kilometres meant I had to really learn how to walk differently so to give parts of my feet a rest of the onslaught. Trail runners are great, but I'd actually suggest proper hiking boots.
* I enjoy smashing out a section really early in the morning so I have lunch and the rest of the day to rest and relax. Time off the trail could be enjoyed alongside the walking.
* There were times I was 99% sure I wanted to give up. Either the path became incredibly monotonous and boring, or I was just in too much pain to enjoy walking further. But persevering to the end has its charms.
* Eating was hard for me. Often times, I would just want to power through without breakfast or lunch. But that was dangerous, even more so I was walking in a 30C heatwave and much of the trail was in open fields. I had plenty of water, but not enough food to give me energy and help recover faster.

### Accommodation

| Day | Start               | Finish              | Accommodation           |
|:---:|---------------------|---------------------|-------------------------|
| 1   | Winchester          | East Meon           | Sustainability Centre   |
| 2   | East Meon           | Cocking             | Manor Farm              |
| 3   | Cocking             | Amberley            | Black House Pub         |
| 4   | Amberley            | Truleigh Hill       | YHA Truleigh Hill       |
| 5   | Truleigh Hill       | Kingston near Lewes | Housedean Farm Campsite |
| 6   | Kingston near Lewes | Alfriston           | Alfriston Camping Park  |
| 7   | Alfriston           | Eastbourne          | (Train home)            |

Finding accommodation along the trail wasn't too difficult; lots of people have posted information online and the Trailblazers guide has many suggestions. Some time was spent making sure I had relatively even distances for each day, and that accommodation was not too far away from the trail which would add on a lot of distance and unwanted descending/ascending.

Accommodation for day 3 and 6 were the only places which weren't directly on the trail. Black House Pub is about a 10 minute walk down a steep hill from the trail. Alfiston Camping Park is about 5 minutes outside the village centre.

It also just so happened that accommodation was located before a big climb, so my legs were fresh and ready to tackle them in the mornings.

### Distances

| Day | Start               | Finish              |  Distance (km) | Elevation (m) |
|:---:|---------------------|---------------------|---------------:|--------------:|
| 1   | Winchester          | East Meon           |  35            | 642           |
| 2   | East Meon           | Cocking             |  28            | 618           |
| 3   | Cocking             | Amberley            |  22            | 402           |
| 4   | Amberley            | Truleigh Hill       |  26            | 597           |
| 5   | Truleigh Hill       | Kingston near Lewes |  23            | 519           |
| 6   | Kingston near Lewes | Alfriston           |  24            | 559           |
| 7   | Alfriston           | Eastbourne          |  20            | 621           |
|     |                     | Total               |  178           | 3958          |

As previously mentioned, I tried to keep each day relatively even in terms of kilometres. I did make some mistakes however.

I originally planned to walk the trail in 5 days which meant distances of ~35km per day. After the first day, my hamstrings were not in the condition to continue such distances, so I scaled each day down. It also meant I could enjoy the walk rather than focussing on the pain.

Day 4 had 22km planned, but it turned out to be 26km. I must have made a mistake reading the map.

I also knew day 7 would be 18km to the official end of the South Downs Way, but would be walking extra to get to Eastbourne train station.

### Performance

Finally, after the South Downs Way was conquered, here are the performance numbers per day. I definitely was not targeting any goals; finishing the whole trail while having fun was the aim.

| Day | Start               | Finish              | Moving time (hrs) | Average pace (mins/km) | Section time (hrs) | Calories |
|:---:|---------------------|---------------------|------------------:|-----------------------:|-------------------:|---------:|
| 1   | Winchester          | East Meon           | 6:45              | 11:40                  | 8:37               | 3696     |
| 2   | East Meon           | Cocking             | 6:00              | 12:39                  | 7:36               | 3055     |
| 3   | Cocking             | Amberley            | 4:48              | 12:45                  | 7:06               | 2623     |
| 4   | Amberley            | Truleigh Hill       | 5:57              | 13:36                  | 8:31               | 3242     |
| 5   | Truleigh Hill       | Kingston near Lewes | 5:02              | 12:51                  | 5:40               | 2164     |
| 6   | Kingston near Lewes | Alfriston           | 5:16              | 12:52                  | 6:29               | 2362     |
| 7   | Alfriston           | Eastbourne          | 4:40              | 13:48                  | 5:10               | 1824     |

On the first day I tried to match my usual walking pace of 10 mins/km. That was a huge mistake given the extra distance and additional weight. Subsequent days were much more sensible and despite fatigue in the legs, I seemed to keep a consistent pace throughout. Days 4 and 7 had particularly challenging climbs which explains the slower page (more details on that later).

The additional distance (compared to the official 100 miles or 160 kilometres) can be attributed to getting to and from accommodation, food spots, or train stations; I tried to stick to the official route as much as I could but it gives a more realistic overall distance.
