Apple showcased iOS7 a few days ago and prompted developers to update their applications to utilise the 64-bit architecture introduced via the new A7 chip.

... I wanted to find out why 64-bit programs are better ... more suited to the chip ... are there really any gains from this?

General[^advantages]: more memory available, and file size access, over 2GB. We refer to coding in C. In this case, the `long` datatype is now 64-bits, and change in pointer size.

Created a new Notes-On page for 64-bit programming. LINK.
