Since you've clicked through to this page, I can only guess you want to view my CV. But before that, let's have some fun!

### Challenge

In the environment below, write a few lines of JavaScript in order to create plain text output matching the content in the target box below.

Once your output matches exactly that of the target, the _not-really-secure_ link to my CV will appear. 

Remember, this is just for fun and uses no server-side scripts. Easy access can be gained via other means. But that is no where near as satisfying!

It shouldn't take more than a few minutes; keep it simple!

### Target

> A _prime_ example of a bar-chart

<div class="highlight">

Be careful with spacing and the numbers at the bottom. Rather than use a brute-force print out, try to come up with clever solutions, such as

- using the shortest amount of code (number of characters)
- the most efficient method (milliseconds or asymptotic analysis of algorithm)

If you are particularly proud of your code, copy it over to [hastebin](http://hastebin.com/), or create a [gist](https://gist.github.com/), and send me a link. I'll showcase the best solutions in a future blog post.

Without further ado, go forth and code! I've prepared the setup for you already. Just set the output of your code into the `<pre><code>` block below.

### Your code

<div class="highlight">
  <textarea id="challenge-their-code">
// Reference the &lt;code&gt; element with ID #awesomeness 
// to display your output. e.g.
// document.getElementById("#awesomeness").innerHTML;</textarea>
</div>
<input type="submit" value="Check" id="challenge-check">

### Your result

<div class="highlight">
  <pre><code id="awesomeness">// The output of your code will appear here ...</code></pre>
</div>

### Status

{:#challenge-status}
Output does not match.

<div id="challenge-the-prize" markdown="1">
### The prize!

{:#challenge-the-message}
You didn't complete the challenge :(

Here's the [link to my CV](/assets/cv.pdf) (it really isn't that special).
