> Virtual Futures was an event that aimed to frame our 'relationship' with technology as one not born of the creation of new tools but in the democratisation of old tools. The most dangerous piece of technology is not always the largest or most expensive, but instead the most low cost and highly accessible. Indeed it was the tension between corporate high-tech and the appropriation of information technologies by counter-cultures that gave birth to the concerns of the original conferences.
